# 🔍 The Prompt Detective

An interactive AI-powered game that teaches the **CO-STAR prompt engineering framework** through engaging detective-style mystery cases.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Receive a Case** — You're presented with a mysterious scenario where an AI prompt went wrong, producing unexpected or hilarious results.

2. **Investigate the Evidence** — Review the faulty prompt and its output. Use your detective skills to identify which CO-STAR element was missing or flawed.

3. **Identify the Culprit** — Select which element of the CO-STAR framework caused the mishap:

   - **C**ontext — Background information the AI needs
   - **O**bjective — What you want the AI to accomplish
   - **S**tyle — Writing style (formal, casual, technical)
   - **T**one — Emotional tone (friendly, professional, urgent)
   - **A**udience — Who the output is intended for
   - **R**esponse — Desired format of the output

4. **Rectify the Prompt** — Choose the correct rectified prompt from multiple options to solve the case!

## 📚 What is CO-STAR?

CO-STAR is a prompt engineering framework developed by [GovTech Singapore](https://www.tech.gov.sg/) that helps structure effective AI prompts:

| Element       | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **C**ontext   | Background information the AI needs  |
| **O**bjective | What you want the AI to accomplish   |
| **S**tyle     | Writing style (formal, casual, etc.) |
| **T**one      | Emotional tone of the response       |
| **A**udience  | Who the output is intended for       |
| **R**esponse  | Desired format of the output         |
